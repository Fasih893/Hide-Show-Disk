# Hide-Show-Disk
Some Windows updates or OEM tools can mistakenly assign a drive letter to the hidden WINRETOOLS recovery partition. This causes the partition to show up in This PC as an extra drive (e.g. “F: WINRETOOLS”). Deleting or formatting this partition is not recommended, because it contains the Windows Recovery Environment and OEM factory tools.
