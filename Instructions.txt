If you’re seeing an extra drive/partition “F: WINRETOOLS” showing up in This PC.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

What WINRETOOLS is?

WINRETOOLS is a hidden recovery partition created by your laptop’s manufacturer (Dell, HP, Lenovo, etc.). It contains Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) and sometimes factory tools or drivers used for:
i.   Repairing Windows if it won’t boot
ii.  Resetting or reinstalling Windows to factory defaults
iii. Running built-in diagnostic utilities
iv.  Normally it’s hidden and doesn’t get a drive letter. 
After an update or disk change, Windows sometimes assigns it a letter (like F:), so it suddenly appears.

How to hide WINRETOOLS using Command Prompt

1. Open an elevated Command Prompt

	Press Win + S, type cmd

	Right-click Command Prompt → Run as administrator

2. Start DiskPart
	
	diskpart

3. List all volumes

	list volume
	
	You’ll see a table of all volumes.
	Find the one with F under the Ltr column. That’s your WINRETOOLS partition.
	Note its volume number (e.g., Volume 5).

4. Select that volume

	select volume <number>
	Replace <number> with the volume number you noted.
	
	Example:

	select volume 5

5. Remove its drive letter

	remove letter=F


6. Exit DiskPart

	exit


Now check This PC — the “F: WINRETOOLS” should be gone, but the partition still exists for recovery.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you’ve removed the drive letter, the partition still exists but it’s “hidden.” You can make it show again simply by assigning a drive letter back.

Show the hidden WINRETOOLS again

1. Open an elevated Command Prompt

	Press Win + S, type cmd

	Right-click Command Prompt → Run as administrator

2. Start DiskPart

	diskpart


3. List all volumes

	list volume


	You’ll see all the volumes.

	The WINRETOOLS partition will now have no letter but will still be listed as “Recovery” or “OEM” with its size.

4. Select the volume

	select volume <number>

	Replace <number> with the volume number of the recovery partition (the one that had F: before).
	
	Example:

		select volume 5


5. Assign a drive letter

	assign letter=F


	(You can choose any free letter, e.g. F, G, H…)

6. Exit DiskPart

	exit


Now open This PC — the WINRETOOLS partition will be visible again under the letter you assigned.
